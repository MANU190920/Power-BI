NYC Airbnb Insights Dashboard
This repository showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard built for analyzing Airbnb listings in New York City. The dashboard allows users to explore insights into listing distribution, pricing, availability, and reviews, helping to understand key trends in the NYC Airbnb market
The dashboard is organized into three main pages:
1) Overview
2) Review Analysis
3) Occupancy and Pricing Insights

Each page focuses on specific aspects of the Airbnb dataset, providing a comprehensive view of the NYC market.
The Overview page presents a snapshot of listings across NYC, including room type distribution, average pricing by neighborhood, and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total listings, average price, and count of hosts. This page quickly highlights high-level patterns in popular room types and neighborhood pricing. The Review Analysis page offers insights into customer feedback and listing activity through visuals such as a stacked column chart on listing availability by neighborhood and room type, a line chart of review trends over time, and a donut chart showing neighborhoods with the most reviews. This section helps users understand which neighborhoods and room types attract the highest engagement from guests. The Occupancy and Pricing Insights page provides an in-depth look at occupancy rates and pricing distribution, featuring a map with markers indicating high- and low-demand areas by neighborhood and a histogram that reveals the concentration of listings by price range. This analysis offers valuable insights into affordability and premium zones within NYC.Several insights emerge from the dashboard: there is a clear preference for more private accommodations, as entire homes/apartments and private rooms are the most popular room types among Airbnb users. Manhattan and Brooklyn show higher average prices, designating them as premium neighborhoods for Airbnb stays. Customer engagement is particularly high in neighborhoods like Brooklyn and Manhattan, as indicated by review counts, suggesting these areas experience strong demand. Additionally, the occupancy rate map and price distribution visuals reveal that high-demand areas, particularly in central neighborhoods like Manhattan, often correlate with higher prices, providing critical information for hosts and market analysts aiming to understand market trends and optimize listing performance.
